Jarvis - A Basic Voice Assistant
Overview
Jarvis is a simple voice-controlled desktop assistant built using Python. This program can understand basic voice commands to perform actions like greeting you, opening websites (YouTube, Google, Spotify), and is set up to send emails (though this feature requires additional configuration).

Features
Voice Greetings: Greets the user based on the time of day (Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening).
Voice Recognition: Listens for user commands using the microphone.
Web Automation: Opens specified websites (YouTube, Google, Spotify) in your default web browser.
Text-to-Speech: Responds to the user verbally.
Email Sending (Configurable): Includes a function to send emails, which requires user credentials and setup.
Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the following Python libraries:

pyttsx3: For text-to-speech capabilities.
SpeechRecognition: For converting spoken language to text.
PyAudio: A dependency for SpeechRecognition to access the microphone.
You can install them using pip:

Bash
pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition PyAudio

Note on PyAudio: If you encounter issues installing PyAudio (especially on Windows), you might need to install pre-compiled wheels or ensure you have the necessary C++ build tools.

How to Run
Save the code: Save the provided Python code as a .py file (e.g., jarvis.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved jarvis.py.

Run the script using the Python interpreter:

Bash
python jarvis.py

Jarvis will greet you and start listening for commands.

Usage
Once Jarvis is running, you can try the following voice commands:

"Good Morning" / "Good Afternoon" / "Good Evening" (Jarvis will respond based on the time)
"Open YouTube"
"Open Google"
"Play music"
Any other phrase (Jarvis will indicate it didn't understand)
Customization and Future Improvements
Email Functionality: To enable email sending, you must replace 'youremail@gmail.com' and 'your-password' in the sendEmail function with your actual Gmail address and a Google App Password.
Important: Using your regular Gmail password directly in the script is a security risk. Instead, enable 2-Factor Authentication for your Google account and generate an App password.
Add More Commands: Expand Jarvis's capabilities by adding more elif conditions in the if __name__ == "__main__": block to handle new commands (e.g., tell the time, open specific applications, search Wikipedia).
Improved Error Handling: Implement more specific error messages or fallback actions when commands are not recognized or actions fail.
Contact Management: For the email feature, consider implementing a way for Jarvis to learn and remember contacts and their email addresses.
Dynamic Music Player: Instead of just opening Spotify, you could integrate with a music player on your system or a streaming service's API to play specific songs or playlists.
